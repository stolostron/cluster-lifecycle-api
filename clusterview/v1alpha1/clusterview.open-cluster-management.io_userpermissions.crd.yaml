          UserPermission represents the permissions a user has across the fleet of managed clusters.
          Each UserPermission item corresponds to a labeled ClusterRole that the user has been granted
          access to via ClusterPermission resources on the hub cluster.
          The name of the UserPermission resource is the name of the ClusterRole.
